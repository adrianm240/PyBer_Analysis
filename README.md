# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data to discern how fares differ by city type. It'll also visualize the total weekly fares by city type in a multiple-line graph to better support the decision-makers. The analysis is primarily conducted using the Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries.

### Urban Ridesharing Analysis
The urban ridesharing analysis identified that this city type resulted in the largest total rides, total drivers and total fares. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver were the lowest of the three city types.

### Suburban Ridesharing Analysis
The suburban ridesharing analysis identified that this city type resulted in the middle of every category analyzed.

### Rural Ridesharing Analysis
The rural ridesharing analysis identified that this city type resulted in the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, but the lowest in total rides, total drivers, and total fares.

## Project Summary
Based on the analyzed ridesharing data, the following are three recommendations to the decision-makers:
  - When expanding into new markets, focus on the urban areas first as they create the most revenue based on fares.
  - Recommend not to focus too much on decisions which consider total fares based on the January to April timeframe since there was minimal correlation between the two.
  - While we have not analyzed data based on mileage per ride and its impact on demand, it appears to be a good recommendation to add more drivers to the suburban and rural city types because they are the most profitable per ride and driver.
